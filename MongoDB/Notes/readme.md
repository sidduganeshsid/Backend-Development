# MongoDB is a DBMS
- NoSQL
- DataStorage -> DB
- Famous DB
- used mostly in Data Analysis, Data Science & Application Development...
(concept = what is it ? why (which is important, logical reasons), how is easy ?)

-it is a Document oriented

Limitations of RDBMS


MongoDB can store Flexible data

now a days, data is important, data driven decisions
with data we do storage and computation.

mongoDB is open source NoSQL based DBMS and can store huge amount of data in the efficient way.
It allows to store data with flexible schema.(means parameters are not fixed)
It can store huge amount of data natively.
It Stores Data in the forms of collections and documents
It Gained Popularity in mid 2000's

It is Natively Scalable
It is a flexible schema

Advantages
mongodb comes with 2 types = free and support

vertical scaling has it's limits.

Horizontal Scaling is best suited

## USE CASES
![ ](image-18.png)
CMS = CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM =>blog posts,likes and comments
startUp's = product data managements
operation intelligence = to perform analysis.
online applications = transcactions, online,..

Sharding in MongoDB

if in sharding one db fails, then what = > solution is data replication.

## How MongoDB stores Data
It is the binary serialization over the JSON
MongoDB store data in less space
It supports large number of data types
![alt text](image-23.png)
![alt text](image-24.png)

mongo db stores data in the form of documents
why BSON ? less space,
![alt text](image-25.png)
1 documents supports size of 16mb. (not more than that.(limitation and fact.))


real world entities are represented as documents (bson)

when data modeling is done. then relationships among it has to be represented then
