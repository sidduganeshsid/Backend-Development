=

anything you open on a browser 
is static
website = collection of multiple wep pages
eg:wikipedia, bloggin website, news websites.

(both are not same)
web app (application)= rendered with the internet on browser which content is dynamic means read and write is possible.

FrontEnd is contains the content and minimal logic


to build webapplication we follow 3 tier architecture.
1st-Layer => FE (layer which enduser interacts)
(netflix,linkedin consists of lots of data)

n/w (restfull API ) b/w the FE AND BE 

2nd-Layer => BE (layer where logics and data logic is present,it is the brain of the system.)
[can be build with Java, Python, Js/NodeJS/Express(this is followed in this course.)]

3rd-Layer => DB (where data is stored)

eg:restaurent.
dining tables -> cheif 

companies uses the frame wor

problems in collaboratin
1.conflicts
2.redundent code

ensure that 
minimun quality.
collaborate easily.
redundancy is avoided.

JS/NodeJS => Express JS is the FrameWork.

HOW DO WE BUILD A BACKEND? 
BE is build in 3 different layers 
1.Routes
2.Coutrollers
3.Model

eg:
first area => Receptionist [role of route](welcome and check the request)
next area => Waiter(main key player) [controller = logic , computation] (where client experience builds)
next area => Cheif () [to deal with the DATA {Model}]

what we should build the first in backend ?
Model -> controller -> routes.
first build the data base schema.
next controller.

thinks as the hotel example.
